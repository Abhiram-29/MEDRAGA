    "context = \"\"\" Ibuprofen is used to relieve pain from various conditions such as headache, dental pain, menstrual cramps, muscle aches, or arthritis. It is also used to reduce fever and to relieve minor aches and pain due to the common cold or flu. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by blocking your body's production of certain natural substances that cause inflammation. This effect helps to decrease swelling, pain, or fever.If you are treating a chronic condition such as arthritis, ask your doctor about non-drug treatments and/or using other medications to treat your pain. See also Warning section.This form of ibuprofen is intended for use in children. Do not give this medication to a child younger than 2 years unless directed by the doctor.Check the ingredients on the label even if you have used the product before. The manufacturer may have changed the ingredients. Also, products with similar names may contain different ingredients meant for different purposes. Taking the wrong product could harm you.\n",

While the current treatment plan is reasonable, the limited long-term benefits necessitate exploring further options. \n",

       "> * **MRI Lumbar Spine:** This will provide detailed images of the lumbar spine to rule out disc herniations, spinal stenosis, or other structural abnormalities.\n",
       "> * **Facet Joint Injection:**  If the MRI is inconclusive, this diagnostic procedure can help determine if the facet joints are the pain source.\n",

       "> \n",
       "> * **Physical Therapy Review:** \n",
       ">     * **Evaluation of current program:** Assess the effectiveness of the current exercises and ensure proper form and technique. \n",

       "> * **Medications:**\n",
       ">     * **Muscle relaxants:**  May be beneficial for short-term use during acute exacerbations.\n",
       ">     * **Neuropathic pain medications:**  If there's a neuropathic component to the pain (e.g., radiating leg pain), medications like gabapentin or pregabalin may be considered.\n",
       "> * **Interventional Pain Management:**\n",
       ">     * **Epidural Steroid Injection:**  If a disc herniation or spinal stenosis is identified, this injection can provide targeted pain relief and reduce inflammation. \n",
       ">     * **Radiofrequency Ablation:** If facet joint pain is confirmed, this procedure can provide longer-lasting pain relief by disrupting the pain signals from the affected nerves. \n",
       "> * **Complementary and Alternative Therapies:**\n",
       ">     * **Acupuncture:** As Rajesh expressed interest, this can be a safe option to explore for pain management.\n",

       "> \n",
       "> **Relationship to Patient History:**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Previous Lumbar Strain:**  This history suggests a predisposition to back issues and highlights the importance of proper lifting techniques and core strengthening.\n",
       "> * **Hypertension:**  Some pain medications may interact with antihypertensive drugs, requiring careful medication selection and monitoring.\n",
       "> * **Occupation:**  Rajesh's desk job contributes to his pain, so ergonomic modifications and frequent breaks are crucial.\n",
       "> \n",

       "> \n",
       "> * **Weight Management:** If Rajesh is overweight, losing weight can reduce stress on the lower back.\n",
       "> * **Lifestyle Modifications:**  Regular low-impact exercise like walking or swimming can improve overall back health.\n",
       "> * **Stress Management:**  Stress can exacerbate pain, so techniques like meditation or yoga may be helpful.\n",

       "> * Discuss the potential benefits and risks of each treatment option with Rajesh.\n",
